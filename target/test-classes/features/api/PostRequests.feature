Feature: I am testing post request for Go Rest API

	@sanity
  Scenario: Post request to create a user in the Go Rest DB
    Given Go rest API is up and running
    And I set header and body to create new user
    When I hit the api with post request and end point as "/public-api/users"
    Then API created a new User in the system
   # And I can find the new user in the system when i get the user
